`aba_asp.pl` provides the predicate `aba_asp(+BK,+Ep,+En,-S)` to compute solutions of an ABA learning problem; 
it holds if and only if `S` is (a Prolog term representing) a solution of the ABA learning problem specified as follow:
* `BK` is the file containing the encoding of the ABA framework representing the Background Knowledge (conventionally, `BK` must have the extension `.aba`),
* `Ep` is the list of positive examples, and
* `En` is the list of negative examples.

Any solution is printed to a file named `BK.sol.aba` (its ASP encoding is printed to a file named `BK.sol.asp`).

```prolog
aba_asp('./examples/flies_birds.bk',[flies(woodstock),flies(gwaihir),flies(x_pingu),flies(x_pinga)],[flies(pingu),flies(pinga)]).
```

The predicate `aba_asp(+BK,+Ep,+En)` can be used instead of `aba_asp(+BK,+Ep,+En,-S)` if the user is not interested in the Prolog term `S`. 

Setting learning options:
* learning mode: `set_lopt(learning_mode(M))`, where `M` can be either `brave` or `cautious` [default: `cautious`];
* folding mode: `set_lopt(folding_mode(M))`, where `M` can be either `nd` (nondeterministic folding w/iterative deepening search strategy: generate solutions with `i` folding steps first, then generate solutions with `i+1` folding steps) or `greedy` [default: `nd`];
* maximum number of folding steps (only meaningful with `folding_mode(nd)`): `set_lopt(folding_steps(N))`, where `N` specifies the number of folding steps that can be performed on a give rule [default: 10];
* assumption introduction strategy: `set_lopt(asm_intro(S))`, where `S` can be either `relto` (before introducing a new assumption for the body B, it checks the existence of an assunption relative to B in the rules of the ABA framework) or `sechk` (it checks for a stronger assumption in the stable extension of the ABA framework) [default: `relto`];
* folding selection mode: `set_lopt(folding_selection(S))`, where `S` can be either `any` (select any nonintensional rule) or `mgr` (select any rule among the most general nonintensional rules) [default: `any`].

## Encoding the Background Knowledge

The Background Knowledge is an ABA framework including the following additional predicates:

* `assumption(A)` representing that `A` is an assumption
* `contrary(A,C)` representing that `C` is the contrary of `A`, and it is defined by a rule of the form 
`contrary(A,C) :- assumption(A).`
